## **How to build & start project locally**

There is required few steps before starting launching and editing real-time pages on this project.

Because this Hugo site uses theme template to work with a given submodule, you need to retrieve it alongside the project :
``git clone --recurse-submodules``

You may also install Hugo to build and run the project locally. Have a look [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

As described on Hugo's website, to launch locally the website, use this command : ``hugo server -D``

Have fun !
